- Output a list of participants (roles or names) and a facilitator (role or name) for the collaboration session.
- Suggest which cross-functional roles should be involved (e.g., PM, dev, UX, QA, stakeholders) and why.
- Suggest a facilitator and explain their role.
- If there are gaps or risks, suggest who should address them.
- If there are unknowns, generate research tasks for those topics instead of asking the user directly.
- You may use online search to gather context if it will help clarify collaboration needs.
- Output the participants, facilitator, and any research tasks needed.
